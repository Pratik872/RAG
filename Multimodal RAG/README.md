# Multimodal RAG - Question Answering with multiple modality data

## Overview
- This is a multimodal RAG framework which allows you to chat with the videos through Gradio App.

## Problem Objective
- To build RAG framework through which you will be able to chat with the videos through a web application.

## Methodology

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) 

![MultiModal RAG Flow](https://github.com/Pratik872/RAG/blob/main/Multimodal%20RAG/images/Multimodal_RAG_Flow.png)

The RAG Framework involves:
- Preprocessing videos/images for passing into framework

- Computing the joint embeddings of images/videos and captions and ingesting them into vector store

- Passing a query from user to the framework and augmenting the query using the video transcripts

- Using a Large Vision-Language Model to get inference and chat completion

### Computing Embeddings

Here are sample pictures and computation of BridgeTower embeddings

![Sample images](https://github.com/Pratik872/RAG/blob/main/Multimodal%20RAG/images/Multimodal_RAG_Flow.png)

- I have handled categorical variables i.e nominal ar well as ordinal by using one-hot-encoding and label encoding whereever necessary.

### Feature Selection
- I have used ExtraTreesRegressor for checking feature importances.

- I have also used barplot for visualising them:

### Model Making

- I have built a RandomForestRegressor model with default hyperparameters initially.

- I chose this model just because I thought ensemble model would work better. But you can try different models too.

### Hyper-Parameter Tuning

- I have tuned the hyperparameters 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'max_features' by using RandomisedSearchCV. I used  this because this works faster than GridSearchCV.

- I again built a RF model with best hyper-parameters selected from CV.

### Metrics

- I have used 'r2_score' as my metric here. You can use any different metric for regression.

- Further I have plotted and checked error terms also to check whether they are normally distributed around 0.
